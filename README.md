# Zigsh - the worst shell known to man

This is yet another learning/passion project. Similar to [libarr](https://github.com/mikkurogue/libarr).
So don't think too much of this, nor use it as your actual shell at all (if anyone ever does this and daily drives this, I'll buy you a beer for sure).

### Supported OS
Currently, this was built and written on an Arch Linux system, using the 6.12.7-zen kernel. So I guess it supports Linux.

Now, I doubt it would necessarily break on Mac OS. Its possible it might work.

Windows, lol.
